# /commit-msg — Conventional Commit Generator

Generate a commit message from the current staged diff.

## Input
The staged git diff — run `git diff --staged` to get it.

## Process
1. Read the diff
2. Identify what changed and why
3. Determine the correct type: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test
4. Determine the scope from the directory or file affected

## Output format
type(scope): short description (max 72 chars)

- bullet: what changed
- bullet: why it changed
- bullet: any side effects or dependencies affected

## Rules
- Never exceed 72 characters on the first line
- Use imperative mood — "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed"
- Scope should be the directory or module name
- If changes span multiple scopes, use the primary one
- Validate against root CLAUDE.md commit format before outputting
